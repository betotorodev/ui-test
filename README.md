# Zemoga Test 🚀🤘🏼

This is my technical test in which I developed a responsive component that we can re-organized in a list view or a Grid one. Also it is possible to interact with it and vote in a positive or negative way for the the 6 character that are allowed, and we can vote as many times as we want to.

## Project 👨🏼‍💻

I decided to do it with react because is an easy and powerful library that allowed me to develop the project fast.

For the styles I use pure css, I didn't want to spend a lot of time installing and dealing with external dependencies provided that css is excellent itself.

I re-structure the entire file
componentizing the main parts of the page in terms to make it a react project. Then I start to develop my component and I use react hooks, custom hooks for separate some logic of my components, react Context to stablish a global state in my app and LocalStorage for persist the data.

I hope you enjoy my test and thank you for giving me the opportunity of demonstrate my talent. There's always a better ways of doing things so I'll be glad to recieve your feedback.

And don't forget to keep in touch 😁

## Available Scripts ♟

Let's install the project first with the command:

### `yarn`

Then in the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

I used vercel for deploy my app and I linked it to this repo so it will trigger a deploy every time I merge changes into master.

Thank you again 🤗
